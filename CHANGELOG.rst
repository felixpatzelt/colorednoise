Changelog
=========

:Version: 2.1.0 of 2022-04-16
Fix by @onnoeberhard for too-small dc-component: When cumulating the generated noise,
the displacement would grow too slowly in the long limit.
Test that would have discovered the above issue.
Other tests are now deterministic.

:Version: 2.0.0 of 2022-04-16

Allow for control over random number generator state by adding optional random_state

Allow for generation of arrays of time series thanks to contributions from

a keyword argument.
